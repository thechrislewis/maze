This is a maze solving algorithm 
It uses a recursive function to solve a 10x10 maze 
created for code club as part of teaching robots.
The challenge is for robot to automatically navigate the maze

The robot will be a microbit robot kit


You will get a list of coordinates returned, which is the path through the maze.
Ideal for guiding a robot

Next we'll need to program robot. Once they've been built
